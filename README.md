##Project Summary

For this assignment, I will create a responsive one-page website with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

I have decided to make a very simple website based only on my skills.

As you can see it is a simple webpage. While doing it I notice coding skills improve as you practise it.

#Development Process

Making this WebResume was a big challenge for me. I spend several days researching and learning. I could see my difficulties with CSS.

As you can see on the file attached I worked on the layout in the Paint program, because I have no experience with Axure RP or any other high fidelity prototype software .

Positioning images, icons and texts was very complicated, navbar also made me lose a little time and some research.

I started to make small codes to see the result and gradually adapted them.

#Initial ideas

When I started thinking abort this Project I wanted make something clean where information would be easy for anyone to find.
